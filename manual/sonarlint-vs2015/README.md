SonarLint is a Visual Studio 2015 extension that provides on-the-fly feedback to developers on new bugs and quality issues injected into C# and VB.NET code. SonarLint for Visual Studio is based on and benefits from the .NET Compiler Platform ("Roslyn") and its code analysis API to provide a fully-integrated user experience in Visual Studio 2015. With version 2.0 you can now establish a connection to a SonarQube server and bind your Visual Studio solution to a SonarQube project. This operation automatically updates the rulesets of the solution and attaches the required Roslyn analyzers to the solution.


## Features

- On-the-fly feedback
- Support C#, VB.Net, Javascript and C/C++.
- Support for standalone analysis.
- Support for connected mode for C# and VB.Net projects.
- [Connected mode] Suppression of issues marked as False Positive or Won't Fix on SonarQube
